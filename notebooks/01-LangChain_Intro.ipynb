      "Okay, the user is asking about the first law of thermodynamics. Let me recall what I know. The first law is about energy conservation, right? It states that energy can't be created or destroyed, only transformed. But I need to be precise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user might be a student or someone starting to learn thermodynamics. They probably want a clear, concise statement without too much jargon. Let me check the exact wording. The law is often phrased as the change in internal energy equals heat added minus work done. So ΔU = Q - W. But maybe they want it in terms of conservation. Alternatively, sometimes it's presented as energy conservation in thermodynamic systems. I should mention both perspectives to cover different ways it's taught. Also, make sure to define the terms briefly. Let me confirm the formula. Yes, ΔU = Q - W is correct, where Q is heat added and W is work done by the system. Alternatively, sometimes work is considered as work done on the system, which would flip the sign. But the key is the conservation aspect. The user might not need the formula unless specified, but since they asked for the first law, including the equation adds clarity. I should keep it simple and to the point as per the user's instruction. Alright, that should cover it.\n",
