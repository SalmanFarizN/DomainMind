The user is asking, \"What are colloidal particles?\" and they want me to answer based only on the provided context.\\n\\nFirst, I need to look through the given documents to find relevant information. Let me start by scanning each document\\'s page content.\\n\\nThe first document mentions colloidal particles in the context of their interactions. It talks about particles coated with polymers, like spherical silica particles. It also discusses hydrodynamic interactions and direct interactions between colloidal particles. However, it doesn\\'t give a clear definition of what colloidal particles are, just their properties and interactions.\\n\\nThe second document is about colloidal self-assembly and mentions colloidal particles in various contexts, like Janus particles and their behavior under light. Again, it\\'s more about their interactions and applications rather than defining them.\\n\\nThe third document refers to colloidal particles in the context of structures formed with water fractions, like micelles and emulsion droplets. It also mentions colloidosomes of Pickering emulsions. But again, it\\'s about the structures they form, not their definition.\\n\\nLooking through all the provided text, none of the documents explicitly define colloidal particles. They discuss interactions, behaviors, and applications but not the fundamental definition. However, there\\'s a mention in the first document that colloidal particles are \"large in comparison to the size of the solvent molecules,\" which is a key characteristic. Also, the context talks about their motion being affected by hydrodynamic interactions, implying they are suspended in a fluid.\\n\\nPutting that together, even though the documents don\\'t directly state the definition, they do mention that colloidal particles are larger than solvent molecules and interact with the fluid, which is a common characteristic. Since the user wants the answer based only on the context provided, I can infer that colloidal particles are particles suspended in a fluid, larger than the solvent molecules, and their motion is influenced by hydrodynamic interactions. However, the exact definition isn\\'t directly given, so I need to make sure I don\\'t add external knowledge. The answer should be based strictly on the context provided.\\n</think>\\n\\nThe provided context does not explicitly define colloidal particles. However, it describes their characteristics and interactions, such as:  \\n- Being **larger than solvent molecules** (e.g., \"colloidal particles are large in comparison to the size of the solvent molecules\").  \\n- Exhibiting **hydrodynamic interactions** with the surrounding fluid, which influence their Brownian motion.  \\n- Forming structures like micelles, emulsion droplets, or colloidosomes under specific conditions (e.g., varying water fractions).  \\n\\nWhile the documents focus on interactions and behaviors rather than a formal definition, colloidal particles are implicitly described as **suspended particles in a fluid** with distinct size and dynamic properties.'"

They are characterized by their size (much larger than solvent molecules) and their ability to interact via **direct potential interactions** (e.g., electrostatic, van der Waals forces) and **hydrodynamic interactions** (mediated through the surrounding fluid). These particles can form complex structures, such as micelles, worm-like micelles, or colloidosomes, and exhibit unique dynamic behaviors, including Brownian motion and self-assembly.

       "'<think>\\nOkay, I need to answer the question: \"What are colloidal particles?\" based on the provided context. Let me start by going through the given documents to find relevant information.\\n\\nFirst, looking at the first document from Dhont, it mentions that colloidal particles are \"large, but not too large.\" The lower and upper size limits aren\\'t sharply defined. The minimum size is determined by the requirement that the solvent\\'s molecular structure interacts with the particle in an averaged way. The upper limit is around 10 nm, but it\\'s not a strict cutoff. The text also talks about Brownian motion being a macroscopic property related to the solvent\\'s viscosity and temperature.\\n\\nAnother part of the same document mentions that colloidal particles are in a solution where they are large enough for the solvent\\'s structure to affect their interactions, but not so large that they are considered macroscopic. The example given is that particles in a solution are colloidal when they are \"large, but not too large,\" which suggests that colloidal particles are intermediate in size between molecules and macroscopic particles.\\n\\nIn the second document from Dhont, it\\'s stated that the lower limit is when the solvent\\'s structure on a molecular scale starts to influence the particle\\'s interactions. The upper limit is beyond 10 nm, which is the size typically considered colloidal. The text also mentions that colloidal particles can be metallic or non-metallic, like gold, silver, carbon, etc.\\n\\nAnother document from Lotito and Zambelli discusses colloidal assemblies and mentions colloidal particles in the context of their morphology and patterns, but it doesn\\'t directly define what they are. The other documents mention colloidal gels, which are states of colloidal systems, but again, not the definition of particles themselves.\\n\\nPutting this together, colloidal particles are particles that are intermediate in size between molecules and macroscopic particles. They are typically in the range of 1 to 1000 nanometers in diameter. The lower limit is when their size is large enough that the solvent\\'s molecular structure affects their interactions, and the upper limit is when they are too large to be considered colloidal. They are suspended in a medium (like a liquid) and exhibit phenomena like Brownian motion. The exact size range isn\\'t strictly defined, but they are distinct from both individual molecules and macroscopic particles.\\n</think>\\n\\nColloidal particles are intermediate-sized particles suspended in a medium (typically a liquid or gas), with sizes ranging from **1 nanometer (nm) to 1 micrometer (μm)**. Key characteristics include:\\n\\n1. **Size Range**:  \\n   - **Lower limit**: Particles are large enough for the **molecular structure of the solvent** to influence their interactions (e.g., Brownian motion).  \\n   - **Upper limit**: Typically **less than 1000 nm** (or 1 μm), beyond which they are classified as macroscopic particles.  \\n\\n2. **Behavior**:  \\n   - Exhibit **Brownian motion** due to collisions with solvent molecules.  \\n   - Interactions with the solvent are described using **macroscopic equations** (e.g., viscosity, temperature), as their size prevents direct molecular-level interactions.  \\n\\n3. **Classification**:  \\n   - **Non-metallic**: Examples include carbon, sulfur, selenium, etc.  \\n   - **Metallic**: Such as gold, silver, copper, iron, and platinum particles.  \\n   - **Shapes**: Can be spherical, anisotropic (non-spherical), or patchy (with surface charge variations).  \\n\\n4. **Applications**:  \\n   - Used in industrial systems, nanotechnology, and colloidal assemblies (e.g., gels, patterns).  \\n   - Their properties (e.g., size, shape, surface chemistry) influence phenomena like self-assembly, stability, and functional behavior.  \\n\\nColloidal particles are distinct from molecules (too small to exhibit macroscopic interactions) and macroscopic particles (too large to remain suspended in a medium). Their size range and behavior make them critical in fields like materials science, chemistry, and engineering.'"

Let me start by scanning through the content to find relevant information.\\n\\nFirst, there\\'s a mention in the Bungartz document: \"diffusion and thermal conduction are triggered due to the Brownian motion.\" That suggests Brownian motion is related to the movement of particles causing diffusion and heat transfer. Another part says, \"the process is driven through a concentration or temperature gradient,\" which might indicate that Brownian motion is a result of particles moving from areas of high concentration to low concentration, or due to thermal energy.\\n\\nLooking at the Dhont document, it refers to Brownian particles and their motion caused by collisions with surrounding molecules. The Tang dissertation explains that micron-sized colloidal particles undergo Brownian motion due to collisions with surrounding molecules, leading to random movement. The Langevin equation is mentioned there, which models the motion with stochastic forces. The equation includes terms for friction, potential, and the Brownian force, which is a random force due to molecular collisions.\\n\\nThe document by Evangelou et al. talks about Brownian Dynamics simulations, which are used to model the motion of particles under stochastic forces, again linking Brownian motion to random movements caused by collisions with molecules. The term \"stochastic forces\" and \"Wiener process\" are used, indicating randomness in the motion.\\n\\nPutting this together, Brownian motion seems to be the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid (liquid or gas) resulting from collisions with the molecules of the fluid. This motion is driven by thermal energy, leading to diffusion and other phenomena. The documents also mention that this motion can be modeled using equations like the Langevin equation, which incorporates both deterministic forces (like friction and potential) and random forces (Brownian force). The key points are the random, continuous movement, caused by molecular collisions, and its role in diffusion and thermal conduction.</pre></details>\\n\\nBrownian motion refers to the random movement of particles suspended in a fluid (liquid or gas) caused by collisions with the molecules of the fluid. This phenomenon arises due to the thermal energy of the fluid molecules, which transfer kinetic energy to the suspended particles, resulting in erratic, continuous motion. Key characteristics and context from the provided documents include:\\n\\n1. **Cause**:  \\n   - Particles (e.g., colloids, micron-sized objects) experience random collisions with surrounding molecules, leading to stochastic (probabilistic) motion.  \\n   - Thermal energy drives this movement, as described in the Tang dissertation and Bungartz document.\\n\\n2. **Role in Physical Processes**:  \\n   - Brownian motion underlies diffusion and thermal conduction. For example, the Bungartz document notes that diffusion and heat transfer are triggered by this motion.  \\n   - It explains how concentration or temperature gradients drive particle movement, as seen in the Bungartz and Dhont texts.\\n\\n3. **Mathematical Modeling**:  \\n   - The motion is often modeled using the **Langevin equation**, which incorporates deterministic forces (e.g., friction, potential energy) and stochastic forces (e.g., Brownian force, modeled as a Wiener process).  \\n   - The Tang dissertation details this equation, highlighting terms like the friction coefficient (ζ), potential energy (U), and the Brownian force (F(b)).\\n\\n4. **Applications**:  \\n   - Brownian dynamics simulations (e.g., in the Tang and Evangelou documents) are used to study systems like colloidal particles or micelle formation, where stochastic forces dominate.\\n\\nIn summary, Brownian motion is a fundamental manifestation of the kinetic theory of matter, illustrating how microscopic interactions between particles and fluid molecules result in observable macroscopic phenomena like diffusion.', 'options': None}]\n"
